"""Interface for a system to run experiments on.

The overall flow of an experiment is as follows:

1. Build machine images (using Packer, if needed or requested)
2. Spin up infra (terraform)
3. run experiment(s)
4. spin down infra (`terraform destroy`, if cleanup=true)

Customizations needed:

1. packer: hopefully this is all always exactly one image

- packer.json
  - plus shell scripts etc.
- packer vars
  - some common
    - instance type?
    - region
  - some specific
    - sha  -- do we need to tar this up? when should it happen
    - src_archive
    - build profile

so probably:

- some function make_packer_vars(spectrum.PackerConfig)
  - might do real work
  - or require temp files -- context manager?

2. spin up infra

- TF
  - this is just `<experiment type>/main.tf`, plus other local file state
- TF variables
  - common
    - AMI
    - region
  - specific (come from Environment)
    - instance type
    - count for different types of machines
- mapping from TF output to Setting
  - ideally:
    - some f: environment x setup x tf data dict -> <iterable of machines to connect to>
    - then in infra(): connect to them all, give a dict or something
      - involves connecting to ssh a lot
    - map that dict to a Setting

3. running an experiment

lots, but i think it all goes in Experiment.run

4. none
